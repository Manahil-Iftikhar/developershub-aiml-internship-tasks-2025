## 🚀 Project Overview

Each task in this internship focused on solving a unique healthcare-related problem using AI. The following table summarizes the developed chatbots:

| Task No. | Chatbot Name                    | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task 1   | Disease Prediction Chatbot      | Predicts the most likely disease based on user-provided symptoms.   |
| Task 2   | Medicine Recommendation Chatbot | Recommends medicines for given symptoms or diagnosed conditions.    |
| Task 3   | Symptom Checker Chatbot         | Offers detailed insights and possible causes for reported symptoms. |
| Task 4   | General Health Query Chatbot    | Responds to common health queries using prompt engineering.         |
| Task 5   | Mental Health Support Chatbot   | Delivers emotionally supportive replies for mental wellness.        |
| Task 6   | Healthcare QA Chatbot           | Answers factual health-related questions using a pre-trained LLM.   |

## ✅ How to Run the Chatbots

### 🔹 Using Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Open any `.ipynb` notebook via Google Colab.
2. Run the cells sequentially.
3. Interact with the chatbot by providing input in the designated cell.

### 🔸 Using VS Code

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manahil-Iftikhar/developershub-aiml-internship-tasks-2025.git
   ```
2. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
3. Set up a Python environment with the required packages:

   * `transformers`
   * `torch`
   * `scikit-learn`
   * `pandas`, etc.
4. Use Jupyter extension or convert notebooks to `.py` scripts as needed.

## 📌 Important Notes

* 💡 **No OpenAI API** was used — all models are open-source and freely available.
* ✨ Tasks 4–6 rely on **prompt engineering** for dynamic interaction with LLMs.
* ⚙️ Some models (e.g., Falcon) may require:

  * GPU acceleration (in Google Colab)
  * Stable internet connection
