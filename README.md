This repository contains all 6 completed tasks from the AI/ML Engineering Internship program at DevelopersHub Corporation.

🔗 GitHub Repository: developershub-aiml-internship-tasks-2025

🚀 Project Overview

Task No.	Chatbot Name	Description
Task 1	Disease Prediction Chatbot	Predicts the most likely disease based on the user's symptoms.
Task 2	Medicine Recommendation Chatbot	Suggests medicines for symptoms or diagnosed illnesses.
Task 3	Symptom Checker Chatbot	Provides insights and information about input symptoms.
Task 4	General Health Query Chatbot	Answers common health-related queries using prompt engineering.
Task 5	Mental Health Support Chatbot	Provides emotionally supportive responses for mental health concerns.
Task 6	Healthcare QA Chatbot	Answers factual healthcare questions using a pre-trained LLM.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3.x

Google Colab – For interactive notebook execution

VS Code – For code development, testing, and editing

Transformers (Hugging Face) – For using LLMs like Falcon, BERT, etc.

Prompt Engineering – For conversational understanding in Tasks 4–6

Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn – Data handling and ML logic

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Optional visualizations (where used)

✅ How to Run

🔹 Google Colab (Recommended)

Open any .ipynb notebook using Google Colab

Run each cell step-by-step

Try various inputs and interact with the chatbot

🔸 VS Code (Optional)

Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Manahil-Iftikhar/developershub-aiml-internship-tasks-2025.git
Open the folder in VS Code

Set up a Python environment (with required packages like transformers, torch, etc.)

Convert .ipynb to .py (optional) or run using the Jupyter extension

📌 Notes

No OpenAI API is used – all models are open-source and freely accessible

Tasks 4–6 leverage prompt engineering for interacting with LLMs

Some models (like Falcon) may require enabling GPU in Colab and a stable internet connection
