## ✅ How to Run

### 🔹 Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Open any `.ipynb` notebook using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run each cell step by step.
3. Try various inputs and interact with the chatbot.

### 🔸 VS Code (Optional)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manahil-Iftikhar/developershub-aiml-internship-tasks-2025.git
````

2. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
3. Set up a Python environment (with required packages like `transformers`, `torch`, etc.)
4. Convert `.ipynb` notebooks to `.py` (optional) or run using Jupyter extension.

## 📌 Notes

* No OpenAI API is used – All models are open-source and freely accessible.
* Tasks 4–6 leverage **prompt engineering** to interact with large language models.
* Some models (like Falcon) may require enabling GPU in Colab and a stable internet connection for downloading the model.
